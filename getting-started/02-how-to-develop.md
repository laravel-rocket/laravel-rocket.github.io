# How to develop your application with Laravel Rocket

Laravel Rocket is designed to build basic code quickly and so that you can focus on busines logic implementation. So after you generate your base code, you can write your own busines logics. Code generated by Laravel Rocket is just a normal application code of Laravel, so you can continue development as same as other Laravel appliocations.

But if you keep following the rule of Laravel Rocket, your code may be more clean and more readable.

Laravel web framework is super lovely but flexibility of this framework is too much for team development. So I created Laravel Rocket to add more rules and constraints to be able to unify coding style to make it more readable and shorten the time for on bording process of new team members.

So Laravel Rocket is not just a framework on framework but also a set of rules and philosophy of coding.
